# 100 Days of Python Programming Repository
Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Programming repository! This extensive collection is designed to provide a thorough exploration of Python programming from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Over 100 days, you'll find a wide range of projects and exercises that cover foundational to advanced Python topics, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), as well as practical applications using popular libraries. Explore diverse aspects of Python programming, including:

1. **Basic Syntax**: Variables, Data Types, Operators, Basic Input/Output
2. **Control Structures**: If-Else Statements, Loops (For, While), Comprehensions
3. **Functions**: Defining Functions, Lambda Functions, Function Arguments, Recursion
4. **Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Data Manipulation
5. **File Handling**: Reading/Writing Files, File Operations, CSV/JSON Handling
6. **Error Handling**: Exceptions, Try-Except Blocks, Custom Exceptions
7. **Modules and Packages**: Importing Modules, Creating and Using Packages
8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
9. **Advanced Data Structures**: Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Heaps
10. **Algorithms**: Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick), Searching (Binary Search), Recursion
11. **Regular Expressions**: Pattern Matching, Searching, Replacing
12. **Libraries and Frameworks**: NumPy (Arrays, Operations), pandas (DataFrames, Data Manipulation), Matplotlib (Plotting, Visualization), Requests (HTTP Requests)
13. **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Data Extraction
14. **Database Interaction**: SQLite3, SQLAlchemy, CRUD Operations
15. **Data Visualization**: Plotting, Graphing, Visualization Techniques
16. **Testing and Debugging**: Unit Testing (unittest, pytest), Debugging Techniques
17. **Concurrency**: Threads, Multiprocessing, Asyncio
18. **APIs and Web Development**: Flask (Web Framework), Django (Web Framework), API Integration
19. **Small Projects**: Calculator, To-Do List Application, Web Scraper, Basic Game Development

Each project and exercise is designed to help you build a solid foundation in Python programming, with practical examples to reinforce your learning. This repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to master Python, from beginners to experienced programmers seeking to enhance their skills.
